# GLFW

## Introduction

GLFW is a free, Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL and OpenGL ES
application development.  It provides a simple, platform-independent API for
creating windows and contexts, reading input, handling events, etc.

Version 3.2 is _not yet described_.

If you are new to GLFW, you may find the
[introductory tutorial](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html) for GLFW
3 useful.  If you have used GLFW 2 in the past, there is a
[transition guide](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/moving.html) for moving to
the GLFW 3 API.


## Compiling GLFW

See the [Compiling GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html) guide in
the GLFW documentation.


## Using GLFW

See the
[Building programs that use GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/build.html)
guide in the GLFW documentation.


## Reporting bugs

Bugs are reported to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues).
Please always include the name and version of the OS where the bug occurs and
the version of GLFW used.  If you have cloned it, include the commit ID used.

If it's a build issue, please also include the build log and the name and
version of your development environment.

If it's a context creation issue, please also include the make and model of your
graphics card and the version of your driver.

This will help both us and other people experiencing the same bug.


## Dependencies

GLFW itself needs only the headers and libraries for your window system.  It
does not need the headers for any context creation API (WGL, GLX, EGL, NSGL) or
client API (OpenGL, OpenGL ES) to enable support for them.

GLFW bundles a number of dependencies in the `deps/` directory.  These are only
used by the tests and examples and are not required to build the library.

 - [getopt\_port](https://github.com/kimgr/getopt_port/) for examples
   with command-line options
 - [TinyCThread](https://github.com/tinycthread/tinycthread) for threaded
   examples
 - An OpenGL 3.2 core loader generated by
   [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) for examples using modern OpenGL
 - [linmath.h](https://github.com/datenwolf/linmath.h) for linear algebra in
   examples


## Changelog

 - Added `glfwSetWindowSizeLimits` and `glfwSetWindowAspectRatio` for setting
   absolute and relative window size limits

   keys

   configuration macros
